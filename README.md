# TO DO LIST IN REACT
This was my first React project in which I learned a lot about the functionalities and capabilities of the framework. I explored how React manages the user interface efficiently through concepts like states and props, enabling dynamic and responsive applications.

I also learned how to create reusable components, which helped in organizing the code better and making it more maintainable. Implementing features to save and retrieve data from the browser's local storage taught me how to persist user information effectively, enhancing the user experience even after refreshing the page.

Throughout this project, I gained hands-on experience in handling user interactions, updating the UI based on state changes, and implementing essential functionalities such as adding, deleting, and marking tasks as completed. This project not only solidified my understanding of React but also prepared me for tackling more complex projects in the future.
